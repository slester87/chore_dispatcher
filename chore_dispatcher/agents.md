## Chore Completion Standards

Every time we approve a chore as work complete, it must meet the following criteria:

- **Compile**: Code must compile without errors
- **Lint**: Code must satisfy the linter with no violations
- **Build**: Project must build successfully
- **Run**: Application must run without runtime errors
- **Tests**: All tests must pass
- **Quality**: Code should be of release quality

These standards ensure that completed work maintains high quality and doesn't break the system.
